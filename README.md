WinRT projection of System XAML is made possible by [Dongle.WindowsSDK.NET](https://github.com/dongle-the-gadget/CsWinRTProjectionForWindows) of [dongle-the-gadget](https://github.com/dongle-the-gadget).

Markup based on C# Markup 2 by [Vincent Hoogendoorn](https://github.com/VincentH-Net) , ported over to System XAML / UWP.

MSIX packaging is inspired by [wherewhere](https://github.com/wherewhere)'s (ab)use of Windows App SDK build targets, based on [CoreAppUWP](https://github.com/wherewhere/CoreAppUWP).
